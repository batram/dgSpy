# Dream of roads

This is dgSpy's ordered roadmap for open product work as of 2026-08-18. It is not a release promise.
The current product already includes verified x64 CLR v4, CoreCLR, and Mono/Unity debugger bridges,
remote-host routing, immutable packaging, compiled HookLab hooks across CLR v4 and CoreCLR, its GUI
editor, and the installed standalone watcher. Preserve those foundations; do not restart completed plans.

## How to travel the roadmap

The numbered roads are open product outcomes, ordered from most concrete to most speculative. Start a
later road only when evidence or an explicit product decision justifies changing that order.

Before starting a road:

- reconcile its motivating documents and old reports with the current code and package;
- reproduce old defects before treating them as open work;
- create or update one bounded task under the separate `docs/local/work` repository.

While working:

- keep tasks, investigations, handoffs, measurements, and live evidence in `docs/local`;
- keep supported behavior, architecture, operation, and public contracts in the main `docs`;
- update architecture, reference, or baseline documents only when their owned truth changes;
- prefer one verified end-to-end slice over several partially real layers.

A road is complete only when its exit evidence is satisfied, not when implementation merely exists.
On completion:

1. Promote durable behavior to the owning product, guide, reference, or baseline document.
2. Close or archive the bounded task and retain detailed evidence in `docs/local`.
3. Remove the completed road and its route-at-a-glance entry; do not add a completion diary.
4. Renumber the remaining roads and repair ordering references.

If only part of an outcome is complete, rewrite the road around what remains.

## Route at a glance

1. Revisit high-risk execution, editing, and scripting one workflow at a time.
2. Keep compatibility expansions parked until product scope changes.
3. Improve HookLab authoring only when a concrete failing hook exists.

## Road 1 - consider high-risk capabilities separately

General target C# execution, assembly editing or project export, live method-body replacement, and
dnSpy-host scripting are separate trust domains. HookLab's bounded compiler authorizes none of them.

If a named workflow justifies one, proceed roughly in this order:

1. Tighten the existing expression and invocation tier per engine.
2. Add deterministic copy-on-write artifact or project export before overwrite support.
3. Consider a digest-verified target payload against a disposable x64 CLR v4 fixture.
4. Consider live replacement only with exact paused-target and original-body guards.
5. Leave dnSpy-host scripting last because it runs with the host user's authority and may not admit
   honest hard cancellation.

Each capability requires its own permission, bounds, audit policy, remote-default-off behavior,
side-effect reporting, and end-to-end refusal tests.

## Road 2 - parked horizons

x86, native debugging, broad Mono HookLab support, reverse patches, generic hook providers,
profiler/ReJIT, and Visual Basic parity remain outside the current x64 CLR v4, CoreCLR, and Unity scope.

Deterministic Unity fixtures, headless Mono connection-failure handling, and broader multi-session
isolation are independent quality projects. Promote one only with a concrete workflow, fixture, and
acceptance boundary.

## Road 3 - improve HookLab authoring when demanded

There is currently no failing base hook that justifies an authoring slice. Generic methods and declaring
types, additional resident compiler references, a larger source boundary, Roslyn editor assistance,
natural collision-safe parameter names, and richer package management are known possibilities, not
open defects. The historical compact VmConnect source proves past pressure but still compiled and ran;
it must be reproduced against the current package before it can motivate a source-boundary change.

Pull one item forward only from a concrete hook that fails on the current verified package. That slice
needs a target fixture that fails before it, compilation and runtime rollback coverage, and the existing
exact MVID, token, signature, and IL identity guarantees.

## Invariants for every road

- Preserve exact session-scoped `module_id` and MVID identity; fail on zero or ambiguity.
- Never turn disconnect into implicit resume, detach, terminate, restart, or hook removal.
- Preserve unknown and foreign-owned resident hooks.
- Keep elevated inputs immutable, closed, verified, and separate from editable policy and state.
- Treat harness failures as possible harness defects until independently observed.
- Distinguish source coverage, package verification, and engine-specific live evidence.
- Run Protocol, Gateway, Extension, composition, pipeline, and applicable live gates in supported order.
- Keep dnSpyEx synchronization routine, bounded, and reviewable; it is not a product road.

The goal is not every imaginable debugger button. It is a product whose next mile has exact identity,
explicit authority, honest evidence, and reversible behavior wherever reality permits it.
